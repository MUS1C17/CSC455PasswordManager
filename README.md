# User Guide
## Initial setup
To get started using this application, clone this GitHub repository. Make sure you've installed python and use pip to install pycryptodome and PyQt5. A virtual environment is recommended to make sure the dependencies are resolved correctly. Once this is done, simply run the app to get started.

## Logging In
Once you start running the app, you'll be prompted to set a master password. This master password will be used to decrypt all of your other passwords, so pick something secure that you can remember. You will be prompted to enter this password every time you use the application.

## Password Management
Once you're in to the main screen of the app, you will have a few options. There are buttons to add, edit, and delete passwords. Adding or editing a password allows you to enter the title of the site, your username, and your password. There is also an option to generate a random secure password. Once these are created or edited, you can use the copy username or copy password buttons to save them to your clipboard to sign in easily. If you need to delete a password, simply click the delete button.
